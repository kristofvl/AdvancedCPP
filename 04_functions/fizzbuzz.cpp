/* Fizz buzz is a word game that teached children about division.
   Players take turns to count incrementally, replacing numbers that
   can be divided by 3 with the word "fizz" and any number that is
   divisible by 5 by "buzz". The game can start at any number, for
   example: 7, 8, fizz, buzz, 11, fizz, 13, 14, buzz, etc.
   Write a function that takes a number to start from, and then
   creates the first 100 outputs for the game, one per line.

   Just use std::cout from iostream for output and '\n' for newlines

   */

#include <iostream>

// enter your function here:


int main() {
  fizzbuzz(7);  // display first 100 outputs, starting from 7
  fizzbuzz(373);  // display first 100 outputs, starting from 373
}
